    <h3>What is FIFA?</h3>
    <p>
      FIFA is a video game in which players can play soccer games against either the computer or humans. It simulates what a real soccer game would be like and each player or computer can control the players on the field to try to beat their opponent.

    <h3>Why is it one of my favorites?</h3>
    <p>
      FIFA has come to be one of my favorite games for a few reasons:
      <ul>
        <li>
          First, as a kid I played a lot of soccer both for fun and competitively. This game me an initial interest in FIFA the video game.
        </li>
        <li>
          Second, my interest in soccer made me interested in professional soccer and within the game players are on their actual teams and have attributes based on their real life performance and abilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, FIFA's gameplay is very simple to start and unbelieveably complex to master. This attracted all of my non soccer playing friends to begin playing FIFA. Playing with friends is not only a reason I love the game but a large reason why most fans like the FIFA series.

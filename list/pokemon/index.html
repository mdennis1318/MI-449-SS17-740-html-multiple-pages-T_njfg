    <h3>What is Pokemon?</h3>
    <p>
      Pokemon is a series of games in which the character goes around catching animal like creatures that have "moves" that allow the pokemon to battle other pokemon. The overall goal of most pokemon games is to become a "pokemon master". This can be acheived by catching as many pokemon monsters as possible and beating a set of challenges to become the champion.

    <h3>Why is it one of my favorites?</h3>
    <p>
      Pokemon is one of my favorite games most for the sheer amount of choice in gameplay allowed. Throughout the story you can choose to continue the story in many different paths. Some of these paths include:
      <ul>
        <li>Training the pokemon you have already caught</li>
        <li>Catching new pokemon in the wild grass</li>
        <li>Completing challenges to become the champion of the region</li>
        <li>minigames within the game such as contests and minigame training</li>
      </ul>
      The list doesn't stop there with even more things to do scattered across the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      On top of the sheer gameplay of pokemon there is a special connection of players to their pokemon that can make them feel attached and like they are raising the pokemon. As a kid thihs was a big part of pokemon for me.

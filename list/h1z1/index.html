    <h3>What is H1Z1?</h3>
    <p>
      H1Z1 is a multiplayer game in which you play as either a solo or on a team and the goal of the game is to be the last team alive. Players can scavenge the huge map for supplies and weapons to help them in their survival effort. A noxious gas spreads slowly across the map forcing teams into closer proximity causing more conflict.

    <h3>Why is it one of my favorites?</h3>
    <p>
      H1Z1 has only recently become one of my favorite games. The reason for this comes down mostly to the hilarious and intense moments that come out of games. In games with your friends you may choose to play a game more seriously or more relaxed depending on the groups feelings. This allows the game to have a completely different feel and keeps the gameplay fresh and fun.

      Other factors that make the game entertaining is the absolutely massive map that never changes but the sheer size of it makes the game almost never get old.
